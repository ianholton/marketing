    phpDocumentor 2 is a tool with which it is possible to generate
    documentation from your PHP source code. With this documentation you
    can provide your consumers with more information regarding the
    functionality embedded within your source and not only what is usable
    to them from your user interface. Documentation generated by
    phpDocumentor 2 does not aim to be a replacement for conventional
    documentation but is rather supplemental, or reference, documentation.
